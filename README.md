## Introduction

I'm playing with a very test-heavy (TDD), object-oriented style of programming and using the Pokemon API to learn. Trying my best to practice Extract Method, Replace Conditional With Polymorphism, and the standard Fowler refactorings. This is a far cry from how I develop at work, so I'm hoping I learn something from it.
